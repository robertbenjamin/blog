> To understand the world at all, sometimes you could only focus on a tiny bit of it, look very hard at what was close to hand and make it stand in for the whole. — Donna Tart, The Goldfinch

#### The Hike

One of my housemates and another friend of ours decided to take a spontaneous hike up the mountains past the far east side of Zurriola beach — we didn't really have a plan, but just started walking towards the mountain and took whichever path looked steeper!

#### Exploring the coastline

The path we took lead us through a few neighborhoods to some less-trodden stone paths, and eventually to the actual hiking trails atop the mountain. These pictures don't do justice. Imagine Studio Ghibli in reality.
