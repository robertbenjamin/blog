Optimism is a flowing web. Twisting, pulsing, stretching out in every direction like the branches of a grand old tree.

Optimism is freedom. It's a open blue sky, it's the great wide sea. It's taking a walk on a crisp fall afternoon.

Optimism is a clear view from the top of a lighthouse. It's bursting through the dark clouds to see the calm waiting above.

Optimism is a brilliant sun setting behind a mountain range, daring you to climb to the peak.

Pessimism is death.

Pessimism is mental confinement. It's standing on a patch of mud in the middle of a bog.

Pessimism is being lost in a dark cave with no source of light.

Pessimism is counting the days until it's all over instead of counting the days which are yours to live.

Step out of the dark room you are in to see the day outside. Break free of the drought of opportunity you've wandered through so long.

Find a thread of life you are _excited_ for and grasp it as tight as you can, for it will lead to more and more and more and more.
