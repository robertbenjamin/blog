title:  "Pumping Our Arms for Points"

*From my journal, December 17 2015.*

The swift adoption rate of software can result in some pretty crazy things. Say someone releases an iOS and Android app that involves pumping your arm (and the phone) in the air for some game.

Say the app hits the homepage of the Verge and Engadget and gets 500,000 downloads in the span of two days (which is entirely feasible).

The person who programmed the app would’ve started a worldwide, immediate physical phenomena in which hundreds of thousands of people perform a weird arm pump according to the app’s instruction. Say the bulk of the downloads occurred in the first hour after the media blast — then arm pumping would've occurred mere hours (or minutes) after the the developer clicked submit.

What a bizarre reality we live in.
