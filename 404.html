  <p>This is terrible. Absolutely terrible. I don't know how or why you've ended up here, but please, please, do *not* watch the video above. I still can't seem to figure out how to remove it and it was never intended to be here.</p>
  <p>You can go directly back to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">the homepage</a>, or check out my writing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive">on the archive page</a>. But don't watch the video!</p>
